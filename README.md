# springTestApp

## Installation guide
1. Before re-compiling the project, it's a good practice to clean it (`mvn clean`). This removes the `target` directory, which contains all the output from previous compilations.

2. To compile the project and also package it (into a .jar file), you can use the package goal (`mvn package`) instead of just compiling (`mvn compile
   `). This command will compile the code and also package it according to the specifications in the `pom.xml` file.
